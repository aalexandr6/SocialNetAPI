# SocialNetAPI

## Project Description

This is a social network API that uses a NoSQL database. It allows users to create a user profile, add friends, and create thoughts. Users can also react to thoughts and add friends to their friend list.

As a Startup,

I want an API for my social netowrk that uses a noSQL database.

So that my website can handle large amounts of data.

```bash
 WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
 THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
 WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
 THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
 WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
 THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my databases
 WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
 THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
 ```

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is used to store data as documents. It is a non-relational database that is flexible and scalable. It is a good choice for this project because it allows for the storage of large amounts of data.

## Dateformat

Dateformat is a package that allows for the formatting of dates. It is used in this project to format the date of the user's post. It is formatted as month/day/year.
